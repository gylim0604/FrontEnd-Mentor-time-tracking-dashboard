## My process

### Built with

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- SCSS
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Had a chance to practice my React Skills. Got to understand how the React Context Api works abit better. I think the biggest part about this challenge was basically the state management. 

Honestly a bit late writing this README so I don't really remember all the things I had to figure out. 


### Continued development

I might further develop or built off this design to make it into an actual time tracker with profiles and user input and stuff just for my own personal use. Seems like it would be fun to try to set up a backend to store all those data and actually get a functional product.
